Idea 2: Multi-Tool Creative Agent
Description: Build an AI agent that writes stories, generates images, and searches the web for inspiration, combining multiple MCP servers.

Components:
MCP Servers:
Story Writer: Generates stories based on a topic.
Image Generator: Creates images for the story (e.g., using a Stable Diffusion API).
Web Search: Gathers inspiration or context.
Groq LLM: Use Mixtral-8x7b-32768 for creative tasks.
LangChain: Use MultiServerMCPClient to connect to multiple MCP servers.
Implementation Steps:
Set Up MCP Servers:
Story Writer Server:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
mcp = FastMCP("storywriter")
@mcp.tool()
async def write_story(topic: str) -> str:
    model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
    response = model.invoke(f"Write a short story about {topic}")
    return response.content
mcp.run(transport="stdio")
Similar servers for image generation and web search (adapt from).
LangChain Agent:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Copy
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_groq import ChatGroq
import asyncio
async def main():
    async with MultiServerMCPClient({
        "storywriter": {"command": "python", "args": ["storywriter.py"], "transport": "stdio"},
        "imagegenerator": {"command": "python", "args": ["image.py"], "transport": "stdio"},
        "websearch": {"command": "python", "args": ["search.py"], "transport": "stdio"}
    }) as client:
        model = ChatGroq(model="mixtral-8x7b-32768")
        agent = create_react_agent(model, client.get_tools())
        response = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Write a story about a dragon and generate an image")]})
        print(response['messages'][-1].content)
asyncio.run(main())
Use Case:
Input: “Write a story about a dragon and generate an image.”
The agent uses the storywriter tool to create a story, the image generator to produce a visual, and optionally searches the web for dragon mythology to enrich the context.
Why This Works:
MCP’s modularity allows multiple tools to work together.
Groq’s speed ensures quick story and response generation.
LangChain orchestrates the multi-tool workflow seamlessly.
